# DASH
This repository hosts a C++ TLM electromagnetic field solver suitable for simulating E and H field interactions in prescribed 2D and 3D cubic geometries discretized with a uniform mesh. 

This software was developed to facilitate my PhD research. Through it I was able to formulate novel PML algorithms and benchmark these against existing published methods. I have now decided to release the source code as it may be useful to any researcher interested in simulating similar geometries or wanting to build on the existing work. 
The implementation and approach taken to mesh and solve are simple and can be easily understood my researchers familiar with the TLM/Finite difference methods. The novelty however is the stable PML algorithms implemented the details of which are published in my journal papers  (See reference list [1]-[5]).
