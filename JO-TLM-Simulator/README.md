# JO-TLM-SIMULATOR : A Time Domain TLM Solver For Electromagnetic Simulations
The JO-TLM-SIMULATOR is an open Source uniform structured mesh TLM code for electromagnetic simulations. It was developed during my PhD program at the University of Nottingham and was used to facilitate the research carried out.

## Code Features

There are 4 main directories in JO-TLM-Simulator 

 __src__:          _contains the source code (.cpp files )_
 
 __Lib__:          _contains the supporting libraries and .h files_
 
 __Analytics__:   _contains the MATLAB and Python scripts_
 
 __Results__:     _the default folder for which all simulations results are stored to be further analysed by the analytics scripts._

Other files included in the directory
make:       makefile
sim.csv:    contains the simulation specifications
